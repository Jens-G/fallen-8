## Welcome to Fallen-8.
Fallen-8 is an in-memory [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) implemented in C#. It's focus is to provide raw speed for heavy graph algorithms.

### Key featues
* **Properies** on vertices and edges 
* **Indexes** on vertices and edges
* **Plugins** for indexes, algorithms and services
* Checkpoint **persistency**

### Sweet spots
* **Enterprise Search** (Sematic adhoc queries on multi-dimensionsional graphs)
* **Lawful Interception** (Mass analysis)
* **E-Commerce** (Bid- and portfolio-management)

## HowTo Clone
Fallen-8 makes use of git submodules, that's why they have to be cloned too.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:cosh/fallen-8.git
$ cd fallen-8
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

## HowTo Use

```
var fallen8 = new Fallen8();

//start the built-in services
fallen8.ServiceFactory.StartGraphService(IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1"), 2323);
fallen8.ServiceFactory.StartAdminService(IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1"), 2323);
```
